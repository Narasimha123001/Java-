        Exercise 6:
        Task: Write the code to find if the given number is a perfect number or not?
        (Perfect number: A perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its
        proper divisors, excluding itself. For example, 6 is a perfect number because its proper
        divisors are 1, 2, and 3, and their sum is 6.)
